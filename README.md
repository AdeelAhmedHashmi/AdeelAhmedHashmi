## The Runtime Profile

I don't just write code; I design data flow. Currently operating out of **Azad Jammu and Kashmir**, I focus on the intersection of security, scalability, and real-time performance. My goal is to move beyond "making it work" to "making it unbreakable."

```typescript
// Current Context
const Adeel: SoftwareEngineer = {
    architecture: ["Event-Driven", "Microservices", "Monolithic"],
    core: "TypeScript",
    mission: "Building production-grade, secure APIs",
    currentFocus: ["Backend Security", "System Design"],
    askMeAbout: ["Real-time Sockets", "Queue Management", "Data Modeling"]
};

 The JavaScript Ecosystem & Arsenal
I view the JS ecosystem as a complete toolkit for full-stack engineering. I select tools based on requirements, not hype.
| Architectural Layer | The Tech Stack |
|---|---|
| Core Runtime |  |
| Server Frameworks |  |
| Data Persistence |  |
| Performance & Caching |  |
| Client State & UI |  |

 Engineering Philosophy
 * Security First: Auth isn't an afterthought; it's the foundation.
 * Type Safety: I rely on TypeScript to catch errors at compile time, not runtime.
 * Scalability: Utilizing BullMQ and Redis to handle load and asynchronous processing efficiently.

Open for Collaboration
I am currently optimizing for technical depth. If you have a complex backend problem, a security vulnerability to patch, or a repository that needs a strict code review, let's talk.
 * What I bring: Clean architecture, strict typing, and performance optimization.
 * What I seek: High-impact projects and constructive code reviews.
